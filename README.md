#  Airline Passenger Satisfaction Prediction

## Problem Statement
A Machine Learning classification project that predicts customer satisfaction using demographic and service-related data collected by airlines.

## Dataset Info
- Records: 129,880 rows × 24 columns
- Target: `Satisfaction` (Satisfied / Neutral or Dissatisfied)

## Project Highlights
-  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
-  Outlier handling
-  Data cleaning
-  Feature engineering
-  Trained 3 ML models

##  Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost

##  Model Performance
 Model                 Accuracy   
 Logistic Regression - 83.00%     
 Random Forest       - 96.45%     
 **XGBoost**         - **96.56% ** (Best Performer)

##  Key Features Impacting Satisfaction
- **Online Boarding**
- **In-flight WiFi Service**
- **Type of Travel**
- **Seat Comfort**
- **Arrival Delay in Minutes**

## Insights & Findings
- Passengers traveling for business were generally more satisfied.
- Online boarding and WiFi services played a crucial role in satisfaction.
- Higher arrival delays significantly decreased satisfaction.

## Future Improvements
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Deployment via Streamlit
- More advanced models like CatBoost or LightGBM
